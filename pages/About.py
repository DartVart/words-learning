st.markdown("2. Then **for a week**, you read that sentence **aloud 2-3 times each day**, concentrating well on the new word. You need to concentrate **really well**! Not repeating it out loud mechanically! It takes about 10 seconds for 2-3 readings. Total for the week â€” 70 seconds.")
st.markdown("3. Then, **a week later**, you read that sentence again 2-3 times (+ 10 seconds).")

st.markdown("To do this, you will need to enter sentence and choose which day the word study will start on.")
st.markdown("*P.S. Don't forget to add token and database ID from notion! **It's not very secure**, but the settings are saved in the url, so you can keep the link with you and quickly go there without reenter settings.*")
